It's true that the parent pom has already included the dependency declaration
in the dependency management section.
But it's not taken into account.
To do so, we should execute the command to install the pom file in the local maven repo.

mvn -f <the absolute path to the parent's pom file> install -N

Be aware that when maven resolves dependencies,
it always looks for pom files already available in the repo.
Instead, local files are not taken into account.
